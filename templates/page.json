The dream of EDDY was conceived years ago but that vision was brought to life at Megan’s wedding where, having recently returned from a trip purchasing textiles in India and London, she created custom pieces for herself and her bridesmaids. With an emphasis on bold and feminine silhouettes, the dresses received such an overwhelmingly positive response that Megan had no other option but to keep sewing together a world of whimsy.<br\/><\/p><p>Pairing elevated California bohemia with global inspiration, EDDY is on a mission to consciously curate a whimsical world. One that helps you feel good on the inside and dress like it on the outside.<\/p><p><br\/>Welcome to EDDY.<\/p>",
